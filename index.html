      <main>
    
            <p>Hi, I'm Taiwo Abiola,  a 42 year old mother of two  blessed with a thriving super market.
            </p> 
            <p>
              As a businesswoman, I normally wake up before 6 a.m. to avoid traffic and arrive at my shop on time.
              </P>
            <p>Everything was well with me until I began to notice pains in my joints, which I ignored and continued to manage since. I assumed my body was simply reacting to the stress associated with my kind of business.
            </p>
            <p>I will have to wake up very early, struggle to get a boss in the morning as a result of Lagos rush hour. Since my shop is in the Island while I live In the mainland</p>
            </p>

            <p>
             My belief was that it would go away with time. 
            </p>
            <p>
            However, it began to worsen with time. I wasn't seeing  any changes, so I believed the solution was pain relievers. I bought a lot of them but it was ineffective. 
            </p>
           
            <p>At a point in time I thought it was a spiritual attack, that my enemies are trying to kill me the way they killed my husband untimely.</p>
                   <hr style="height:1px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:rgb(153,15,61)"><br>

            <p>My pastor prayed for me.</p>
            <p>And also advised me to come to Lagos University Teaching Hospital(LUTH) to have some checkups as he work there as a specialist doctor</p>
            
            <p>
            After several tests and examination, I was told I'm  suffering from Arthritis and I've been given several medications, but they only work for a short time. 
            </p>
            <p>The medication I was given would only work for a few weeks before the pain would come back and torture me deep inside my bones.
            </p>
            <p>
            That nearly paralyzed me. Before you know it I'm back to square on. I was advised that the only way out was to get surgery.

            </p>

            <hr style="height:1px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:rgb(153,15,61)"><br>

            <p>
           Instead of having surgery, I choose to leave this world. I had given up on EVERYTHING since I've tried different medication

            </p>

            <p>
            Call it destiny, good fortune, or a sign from above </p>
           <p>I finally got my breakthrough and answers through Dr. Amar – a friend I had not communicated with for over 9 years.
           </p>
           <p>Dr. Amar comes from a small jungle-like tribe in India where men and women in their 90s still walk several miles to work on their farms.
           </p>
           <p>He is a certified orthopedist and nutritional specialist who spent his life learning how our bones and joints work.
           </p>
           <p>After listening to my cry… he recommended <span style="color: rgb(153,15,61); font-weight: 700px;"><strong>Boniac & Boscure</strong></span>, a natural flora, and 2-in-1 Arthritis destroyer he developed — to help repair my cartilage.
           </p>
           <p>He sent it and I tried it.
           </p>

           <div class="ntc">
            <p>"I noticed a big difference the first week— it felt like someone finally loosened the tight screw causing pain in my knees

            </p>
            <p>Then I felt relief on my back too.
 
            </p>
            <p>My biggest fear is that the pain was just temporarily gone and would come back…
 
            </p>
            
            <p>But I was shocked the pain continued to reduce every week until it finally disappeared.
 
            </p>
            <p>Since then I could move my joints more with no pain and stiffness."
           </div>
          

           </p>


           <p>My 4-year-long Arthritis was gone in 3 short months… and my joints had completely re-strengthened in 90 days.

           </p>
           <p>I was now able to walk freely without using a wheel chair

           </p>
           <p>Now I go through each day with sky-high energy to help me work without feeling disturbed at all.

           </p>
           <p>Ever since then, I have been prescribing this 2 in 1 arthritis destroyer made from an ancient natural flora to all those that are suffering from arthritis

           </p>

           <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 700; border-left: 5px solid rgb(153,15,61); padding-left: 10px; font-style: italic;">Over 3,567 Nigerians have used Boscure & Boniac reported that their grueling pain in their knees, hands, necks and backs had magically disappeared.

           </p>
           <hr style="height:1px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:rgb(153,15,61)"><br>

           <p>All you need to do is…

           </p>
           <p>Take one pill of <strong>Boscure</strong>  at night before you sleep — it'll work overnight and make sure you wake up energized the next day.

           </p>
           <p>It does this by going inside your body and stopping the inflammatory proteins from attacking the synovial fluids that support your joint.

           </p>
           <hr style="height:1px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:rgb(153,15,61)"><br>

           </p>
           <hr style="height:1px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:rgb(153,15,61)"><br>

           <p>Imagine what your life would be when …

           </p>
           <p>You’ll start sleeping like a baby with… no headache… but waking up every day feeling more energized.

           <hr style="height:1px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:rgb(153,15,61)"><br>

           <p>Now, how much should this safe and long-lasting Arthritis destroyer cost?

           </p>
           <p>Some people would be willing to pay thousands of naira to make it go away forever

           </p>
           
           <p>So forget whatever price you have in mind. I won't overcharge you. I have a good-paying job to take care of my family.
           </p>
           <p>But when it comes to natural formulas, you wouldn't expect it to be cheap either….

           </p>
           <p>Since a lot of testing, inspection, and quality control goes into each production.

           </p>
           <p>It either meets the standard or gets thrown away – which costs a lot of work and money

           </p>
           <p>So we came up with a way to make this affordable for you by eliminating pharmacies and middlemen.

           </p>
           <hr style="height:1px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:rgb(153,15,61)"><br>
